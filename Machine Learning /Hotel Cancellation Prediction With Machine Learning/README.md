# Hotel Cancellation Rate Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict hotel booking cancellations using historical booking data. The project explores various features that influence cancellations, such as lead time, customer type, market segment, and previous cancellations, to build a robust predictive model. The objective is to help hotel management make informed decisions to minimize cancellation rates and optimize occupancy.

## Project Objectives
- **Data Exploration:** Understand the dataset and identify key features that influence hotel booking cancellations.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the data for model training, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- **Model Development:** Train and evaluate different machine learning models to predict the likelihood of booking cancellations.
- **Feature Importance:** Analyze the importance of various features in predicting cancellations.
- **Model Evaluation:** Compare model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Insights and Recommendations:** Provide actionable insights and recommendations to hotel management based on the model's predictions.

## Datasets Overview
The dataset used in this project contains 119,390 records of hotel bookings. It includes various features such as:
- **Booking Details:** Hotel type, arrival date, lead time, booking changes, and cancellation status.
- **Guest Information:** Number of adults, children, babies, and whether the guest is a repeated guest.
- **Stay Information:** Number of weekend nights and weeknights stayed, type of meal plan, reserved and assigned room type.
- **Booking Channels:** Market segment, distribution channel, and agent/company information.
- **Additional Details:** Special requests, deposit type, and reservation status.

The dataset includes a total of 32 columns with both categorical and numerical data types.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - **Data Manipulation:** `pandas`, `numpy`
  - **Data Visualization:** `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - **Machine Learning:** `scikit-learn`
  - **Model Evaluation:** `scikit-learn.metrics`

## Project Structure
- **`Hotel_Cancellation_Rate_Prediction_ML.ipynb`:** The Jupyter notebook containing the code for data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- **`hotel_bookings.csv`:** The dataset used for training and evaluating the models.
- **`README.md`:** The project description and documentation.
- **`images/`:** Directory for storing visualizations and plots generated during the project.

## Key Findings
- **Lead Time:** Longer lead times are associated with a higher probability of cancellations.
- **Customer Type:** Transient customers are more likely to cancel compared to other types.
- **Market Segment:** Online Travel Agents (OTAs) have a higher cancellation rate compared to other distribution channels.
- **Previous Cancellations:** Guests with previous cancellations are more likely to cancel again.

## Conclusion
The project successfully developed a predictive model for hotel booking cancellations with reasonable accuracy. The findings highlight key factors influencing cancellations, providing valuable insights for hotel management to reduce cancellation rates. By understanding these factors, hotels can take proactive measures, such as offering incentives for non-cancellation or targeting specific customer segments with personalized offers.

## Future Work
- **Model Improvement:** Explore advanced machine learning models like ensemble methods and neural networks.
- **Real-time Prediction:** Implement the model in a real-time booking system to provide immediate cancellation predictions.
- **Further Analysis:** Investigate the impact of external factors such as economic conditions or seasonal trends on cancellation rates.
